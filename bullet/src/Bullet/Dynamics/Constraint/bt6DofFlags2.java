2014 May: btGeneric6DofSpring2Constraint is created from the original (2.82.2712) btGeneric6DofConstraint by Gabor Puhr and Tamas Umenhoffer
Pros:
- Much more accurate and stable in a lot of situation. (Especially when a sleeping chain of RBs connected with 6dof2 is pulled)
- Stable and accurate spring with minimal energy loss that works with all of the solvers. (latter is not true for the original 6dof spring)
- Servo motor functionality
- Much more accurate bouncing. 0 really means zero bouncing (not true for the original 6odf) and there is only a minimal energy loss when the value is 1 (because of the solvers' precision)
- Rotation order for the Euler system can be set. (One axis' freedom is still limited to pi/2)

Cons:
- It is slower than the original 6dof. There is no exact ratio, but half speed is a good estimation.
- At bouncing the correct velocity is calculated, but not the correct position. (it is because of the solver can correct position or velocity, but not both.)
