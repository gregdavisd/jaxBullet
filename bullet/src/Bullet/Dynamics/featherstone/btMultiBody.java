/*
 * PURPOSE:
 *   Class representing an articulated rigid body. Stores the body's
 *   current state, allows forces and torques to be set, handles
 *   timestepping and implements Featherstone's algorithm.

 *   Portions written By Erwin Coumans: connection to LCP solver, various multibody constraints, replacing Eigen math library by Bullet LinearMath and a dedicated 6x6 matrix inverse (solveImatrix)
 *   Portions written By Jakub Stepien: support for multi-DOF constraints, introduction of spatial algebra and several other improvements
